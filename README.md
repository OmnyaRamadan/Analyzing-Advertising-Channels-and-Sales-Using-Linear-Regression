# Analyzing-Advertising-Channels-and-Sales-Using-Linear-Regression
In this data science project, we utilize the advertising dataset provided in the ISLR (Introduction to Statistical Learning with R) to explore the relationship between various advertising channels ('TV,' 'radio,' and 'newspaper') and 'sales' using a linear regression model. By conducting a thorough analysis of the data, we aim to uncover insights into how each advertising medium impacts sales individually. This project will help businesses make informed decisions about their advertising budgets and strategies, based on quantifiable data-driven conclusions.
